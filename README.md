# py4xs

This is a python package for processing x-ray scattering data. It 
was first developed at the X9 beamline at NSLS. Since then, it has been 
revised multiple times and is now being used at the LiX beamline at NSLS-II. 
Compared to the previous versions, the major changes in this version are:

1. Revision of the conversion between detector images and the corresponding
intensity maps, with coordinates of qr-qz, q-phi, or just q. The conversions
are now realized using histograms. 

2. 2D plot of the data has been improved, with enhanced features to annotate 
the scattering intensity.

3. Added examples to illustrate the use of this module in various x-ray
scattering measurements.
